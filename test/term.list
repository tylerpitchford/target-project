The
military
history
of
France
encompasses
an
immense
panorama
of
conflicts
and
struggles
extending
for
more
than
2,000
years
across
areas
including
modern
France,
greater
Europe,
and
French
territorial
possessions
overseas.
According
to
the
British
historian
Niall
Ferguson,
France
has
participated
in
168
major
European
wars
since
387
BC,
out
of
which
they
have
won
109,
drawn
10
and
lost
49:
this
makes
France
the
most
successful
military
power
in
European
history
-
in
terms
of
number
of
fought
and
won.[4]
The
Gallo-Roman
conflict
predominated
from
60
BC
to
50
BC,
with
the
Romans
emerging
victorious
in
the
conquest
of
Gaul
by
Julius
Caesar.
After
the
decline
of
the
Roman
Empire,
a
Germanic
tribe
known
as
the
Franks
took
control
of
Gaul
by
defeating
competing
tribes.
The
"land
of
Francia,"
from
which
France
gets
its
name,
had
high
points
of
expansion
under
kings
Clovis
I
and
Charlemagne.
In
the
Middle
Ages,
rivalries
with
England
and
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
prompted
major
conflicts
such
as
the
Norman
Conquest
and
the
Hundred
Years'
War.
With
an
increasingly
centralized
monarchy,
the
first
standing
army
since
Roman
times,
and
the
use
of
artillery,
France
expelled
the
English
from
its
territory
and
came
out
of
the
Middle
Ages
as
the
most
powerful
nation
in
Europe,
only
to
lose
that
status
to
Spain
following
defeat
in
the
Italian
Wars.
The
Wars
of
Religion
crippled
France
in
the
late
16th
century,
but
a
major
victory
over
Spain
in
the
Thirty
Years'
War
made
France
the
most
powerful
nation
on
the
continent
once
more.
In
parallel,
France
developed
its
first
colonial
empire
in
Asia,
Africa,
and
in
the
Americas.
Under
Louis
XIV,
France
achieved
military
supremacy
over
its
rivals,
but
escalating
conflicts
against
increasingly
powerful
enemy
coalitions
checked
French
ambitions
and
left
the
kingdom
bankrupt
at
the
opening
of
the
18th
century.
Free

Battle
of
Bir
Hakeim
(1942).
Resurgent
French
armies
secured
victories
in
dynastic
conflicts
against
the
Spanish,
Polish,
and
Austrian
crowns.
At
the
same
time,
France
was
fending
off
attacks
on
its
colonies.
As
the
18th
century
advanced,
global
competition
with
Great
Britain
led
to
the
Seven
Years'
War,
where
France
lost
its
North
American
holdings.
Consolation
came
in
the
form
of
dominance
in
Europe
and
the
American
Revolutionary
War,
where
extensive
French
aid
in
the
form
of
money
and
arms,
and
the
direct
participation
of
its
army
and
navy
led
to
America's
independence.[3]
Internal
political
upheaval
eventually
led
to
23
years
of
nearly
continuous
conflict
in
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
and
the
Napoleonic
Wars.
France
reached
the
zenith
of
its
power
during
this
period,
dominating
the
European
continent
in
an
unprecedented
fashion
under
Napoleon
Bonaparte,
but
by
1815
it
had
been
restored
to
its
pre-Revolutionary
borders.
The
rest
of
the
19th
century
witnessed
the
growth
of
the
Second
French
colonial
empire
as
well
as
French
interventions
in
Belgium,
Spain,
and
Mexico.
Other
major
wars
were
fought
against
Russia
in
the
Crimea,
Austria
in
Italy,
and
Prussia
within
France
itself.
Following
defeat
in
the
Franco-Prussian
War,
Franco-German
rivalry
erupted
again
in
the
First
World
War.
France
and
its
allies
were
victorious
this
time.
Social,
political,
and
economic
upheaval
in
the
wake
of
the
conflict
led
to
the
Second
World
War,
in
which
the
Allies
were
defeated
in
the
Battle
of
France
and
the
French
government
surrendered
and
was
replaced
with
an
authoritarian
regime.
The
Allies,
including
the
government
in
exile's
Free
French
Forces
and
later
a
liberated
French
nation,
eventually
emerged
victorious
over
the
Axis
powers.
As
a
result,
France
secured
an
occupation
zone
in
Germany
and
a
permanent
seat
on
the
United
Nations
Security
Council.
The
imperative
of
avoiding
a
third
Franco-German
conflict
on
the
scale
of
those
of
two
world
wars
paved
the
way
for
European
integration
starting
in
the
1950s.
France
became
a
nuclear
power
and
since
the
1990s
its
military
action
is
most
often
seen
in
cooperation
with
NATO
and
its
European
partners.
The
Hitchhiker's
Guide
to
the
Galaxy
is
a
comedy
science
fiction
series
created
by
Douglas
Adams.
Originally
a
radio
comedy
broadcast
on
BBC
Radio
4
in
1978,
later
it
was
adapted
to
other
formats,
and
over
several
years
it
gradually
became
an
international
multi-media
phenomenon.
Adaptations
have
included
stage
shows,
a
"trilogy"
of
five
books
published
between
1979
and
1992,
a
sixth
novel
penned
by
Eoin
Colfer
in
2009,
a
1981
TV
series,
a
1984
computer
game,
and
three
series
of
three-part
comic
book
adaptations
of
the
first
three
novels
published
by
DC
Comics
between
1993
and
1996.
There
were
also
two
series
of
towels,
produced
by
Beer-Davies,
that
are
considered
by
some
fans
to
be
an
"official
version"
of
The
Hitchhiker's
Guide
to
the
Galaxy,
as
they
include
text
from
the
first
novel.[1][2]
A
Hollywood-funded
film
version,
produced
and
filmed
in
the
UK,
was
released
in
April
2005,
and
radio
adaptations
of
the
third,
fourth,
and
fifth
novels
were
broadcast
from
2004
to
2005.
Adams
did
many
of
these
adaptations,
including
the
novels,
the
TV
series,
the
computer
game,
and
the
earliest
drafts
of
the
Hollywood
filmâ€™s
screenplay,
and
some
of
the
stage
shows
introduced
new
material
written
by
Adams.
The
title
is
the
name
of
a
fictional,
eccentric,
electronic
travel
guide,
The
Hitchhiker's
Guide
to
the
Galaxy,
prominently
featured
in
the
series.
The
Hitchhiker's
Guide
to
the
Galaxy[3]
is
often
abbreviated
"HG2G"
[4]
and
"HHGTTG"
[5]
used
on
fan
also
"H2G2"
used
by
Neil
Gaiman
as
a
chapter
title
in
Don't
Panic
and
later
by
the
online
The
series
is
also
often
referred
to
as
"The
Hitchhiker's
Guide",
"Hitchhiker's",
or
simply
"[The]
Guide".
This
title
can
refer
to
any
of
the
various
incarnations
of
the
story
of
which
the
books
are
the
most
widely
distributed,
having
been
translated
into
more

by

Warp
drive
is
a
hypothetical
faster-than-light
(FTL)
propulsion
system
in
many
works,
most
notably
Star
Trek.
A
spacecraft
equipped
with
a
warp
drive
may
travel
at
apparent
speeds
greater
than
that
of
light
by
many
orders
of
magnitude,
while
circumventing
the
relativistic
problem
of
time
dilation.
In
contrast
to
many
other
FTL
technologies,
such
as
a
jump
drive
or
the
Infinite
Improbability
Drive,
the
warp
drive
does
not
permit
instantaneous
travel
between
two
points;
instead,
warp
drive
technology
creates
an
artificial
"bubble"
of
normal
space-time
which
surrounds
the
spacecraft
opposed
to
entering
a
separate
realm
or
dimension
like
hyperspace,
as
is
used
in
the
Star
Wars,
Stargate,
Warhammer
40,000,
Babylon
5,
Cowboy
Bebop,
and
Andromeda
Consequently,
spacecraft
at
warp
velocity
can
continue
to
interact
with
objects
in
"normal
space".
Some
of
the
other
fiction
in
which
warp
drive
technology
is
featured
include:
Stars!,
EVE
Online,
Earth
and
Beyond,
StarCraft,
DarkSpace,
Starship
Troopers,
Doctor
Who,
and
Star
Ocean.
